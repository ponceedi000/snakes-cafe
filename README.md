## Overview

- This is the first console project I've ever built with Python. Super fun!

- Basic Python


## Credit and Collaborations

- Brandon Mizutani. Him and I got together to problem solve some tricky tasks. One example would be such as how to handle the user input of "Submit". We talked through how we would solve this in JavaScript then executed the idea with Python's syntax. We also discussed how we would refactor our Python code upon solving the assignmnet tasks.
